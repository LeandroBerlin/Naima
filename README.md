## Problem

Social fundraising relies on **trust** = no trust no investments/money/visibility

_"43% of the people don't trust charity Organizations"_  
source: [NCVO - Trust and confidence in charities report UK 2014](documents/trust-and-confidence-in-charities-report.pdf)

People tends to trust less the small initialives (trend from the last years): _"small nonprofits, with annual total fundraising less than $1 million, experienced a 2.3% decrease in fundraising results compared to 2017."_

## Solution

Empower trust by showing donors/charity investors what impact their money makes with a transparent process from start to end

➡️ Documented donations process  
 ➡️ Clear project goals  
 ➡️ Transparent investment  
 ➡️ Tracked results

## How

“Blockchain technology presents amazing solutions to common problems nonprofits may face. Because a blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger, everyone who accesses the data technically owns a copy of it, and said data cannot ever be changed once it is appended to the chain. Thus, by its very nature, information on the blockchain is entirely transparent, and unable to be manipulated by an external force or even the institution itself. Nonprofit institutions can leverage this transparent infrastructure to engage donors and increase overall trust in their organization. Particularly for smaller nonprofits without a ubiquitous brand name, a public blockchain-based ledger would ensure accountability and help the organization garner trust directly from the distribution of assets.”

IBM is using blockchain to improve transparency in supply chains for internal stakeholders (Hyperledger project from LinuxFoundation), start-ups such as [Provenance](https://www.provenance.org) and [Everledger](https://www.everledger.io) are using blockchain to provide supply-chain transparency directly to consumers.
